Two project objectives: **Learn basic graphics** and **gain optimization experience**

So firstly I learnt openGL and made my program capable of rendering bouncing spheres inside a transparent box using basic lighting. (Also integrated imGUI). See version #1

The second objective is to optimize the program. I intentionally used naive phsysics (sphere-sphere collisions) and naive rendering (no instancing) at first so I could see the effect. I also chose a simple ball collision program so I can focus on technique rather than scenario specific optimisation.
